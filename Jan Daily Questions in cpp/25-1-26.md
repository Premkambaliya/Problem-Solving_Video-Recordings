# 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores

**Date:** January 25, 2026
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return *the minimum possible difference*.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        for(int i=k-1;i<n;i++) {
            int min_element = nums[i-k+1];
            int max_element = nums[i];
            minDiff = min(minDiff, max_element - min_element);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N log N)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
