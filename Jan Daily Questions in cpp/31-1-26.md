# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Description
You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and a character `target`. There are **at least two different** characters in `letters`.

Return *the smallest character in* `letters` *that is lexicographically greater than* `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        for(int i=0;i<letters.size();i++){
            if(letters[i] > target){
                return letters[i];
            }
        }
        return letters[0];
    }
};
```
