# 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid

**Date:** January 3, 2026  
**Difficulty:** Hard

## Problem Description
You have a grid of size n × 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;

        long long same = 6;  // ABA type
        long long diff = 6;  // ABC type

        for (int row = 2; row <= n; row++) {
            long long nextSame = (same * 3 + diff * 2) % MOD;
            long long nextDiff = (same * 2 + diff * 2) % MOD;

            same = nextSame;
            diff = nextDiff;
        }

        return (same + diff) % MOD;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
